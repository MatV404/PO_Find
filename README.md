# PO_Find
Po_Find is a small application which I created as a project at the end of the 2. trimester of Microsoft 
Student Training Center, a program which I am a part of.
Po_Find provides information about different objects and organizations which can be found in my city, 
Prešov. The user can simply look up objects and organizations by writing a part of their name, after which a scroll list
pops up with recommendations based on data provided by the user. Clicking on the name of an object redirects the user
to a different page which contains information about the given object. This data is taken from a .JSON file provided as
open data by the city of Prešov.

Personally, I chose this project to practice working with a .JSON file type in C#.

This application was written in C#.
